# URGENT MANUAL FIX - Render Dashboard

## The Issue
Render has cached Python 3.9.18 in your service configuration. Even though we've removed all version files, the service itself has this setting stored.

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION - Manual Render Dashboard Fix

### Step 1: Go to Render Dashboard
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click on your "TripBox-IntelliOrganizer" service

### Step 2: Update Environment Settings
1. Click "Settings" tab
2. Scroll to "Environment Variables"
3. Look for any PYTHON_VERSION variable and DELETE it
4. Look for any RUNTIME variable and DELETE it

### Step 3: Force Redeploy
1. Go to "Deploys" tab
2. Click "Manual Deploy"
3. Choose "Clear build cache & deploy"

### Step 4: Alternative - Create New Service
If above doesn't work:
1. Click "New +" in Render dashboard
2. Choose "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub repo
4. Service name: "tripbox-new"
5. Root directory: leave blank
6. Build command: "cd backend && pip install flask"
7. Start command: "cd backend && python app.py"

## Current Code Status
I've created the simplest possible setup:
- runtime.txt with Python 3.8.18 (widely available)
- Procfile for standard deployment
- Ultra-minimal Flask app
- Only Flask dependency

## Deploy After Manual Fix
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Minimal setup with Python 3.8.18"
git push origin main
```

## Expected URL
After successful deployment: https://tripbox-intelliorganizer.onrender.com

The manual dashboard fix should resolve the cached Python version issue immediately.
