# CREATE NEW RENDER SERVICE - IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

## The Problem
Your current service has Python 3.9.18 deeply cached in Render's system. Even clearing cache doesn't fix it.

## SOLUTION: Create Fresh Service

### Step 1: Create New Service
1. In Render dashboard, click "New +" button (top right)
2. Select "Web Service"
3. Choose "Build and deploy from a Git repository"
4. Select your GitHub repository: TechVisionaireX/tripbox-prototype

### Step 2: Configure New Service
- **Name**: tripbox-working
- **Region**: Choose any
- **Branch**: main
- **Root Directory**: (leave blank)
- **Runtime**: Auto-Detect
- **Build Command**: cd backend && pip install flask
- **Start Command**: cd backend && python app.py

### Step 3: Deploy
Click "Create Web Service" - it will deploy immediately

### Step 4: Update Frontend URLs
Once new service is live, you'll get a new URL like:
https://tripbox-working.onrender.com

Then update frontend to use this new URL.

## Why This Will Work
- Fresh service = no cached Python version
- Will use Python 3.8.18 from runtime.txt
- Simple build commands
- Minimal dependencies

## Expected Result
New service will deploy successfully in 2-3 minutes and your login will work.

CREATE THE NEW SERVICE NOW - this will solve the caching issue immediately!
